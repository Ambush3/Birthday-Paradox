# Birthday-Paradox

Birthday Paradox is a high probability that two people will have the same birthday.
This program performs probability experiments to determine the likelihood for groups of people of different sizes.

There is more than a 50% chance that two people are born on the same day, in a small group of 23 people.
We think we are making only 22 comparisons, and that there are only 22 chances of sharing the birthday with someone.

However, the number is much larger and it's the reason this is considered a paradox.
In total, the amount of comparisons between 23 people, would actually be 253 comparisions.
